## Particle System project

> Theme: Feeling Lonely in a crowd

---

Brainstorming ideas:

- Portraying the theme in a meaningful manner that would reflect on author's own experiences within various constructed communities
- Use of audio to provide a more impactful experience to the audience.
- Emphasis on the isolation within a crowd.
  - Visual communication of the notion.
  - Difference between the main particle that (feels) lonely within a noisy system of (different) particles.
- Use of intensity of sound and visual particle movement.
- To portray multiple crowds, in order to communicate the theme further, rapidly changing particles that surround the main (lonely) particle.
  - This is to construct the narrative which also progresses with the help of sound accompanying the piece.
  - However, sound is one of the main parts of the piece.
