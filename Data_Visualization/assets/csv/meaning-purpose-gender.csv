Date,Note
"2022-11-17","On November 17, 2022, a correction was made to this table to apply the appropriate label for “urban areas”. Before this correction, urban areas were labelled as “population centres” which is not the concept used in this table. The associated footnote was also corrected to reflect the definitions of “urban areas” and “rural areas” used in this table. The values of these statistics remain the same but the correction ensures the concepts are correctly labelled and defined."
"2022-06-21","On June 21, 2022, a correction was made to this table to indicate that the following statistics are presented in thousands: the number of persons, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the number of persons, and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the number of persons. The values of these statistics remain the same but the correction ensures that they are correctly labelled as being in thousands. This affected the following reference periods: Q2 2021, Q3 2021, Q4 2021 and Q1 2022."



Footnotes:

2,"The quarterly reference periods correspond to Canadian Social Survey (CSS) data collection periods, also referred to as CSS waves. “Q2 2021” refers to Wave 1 of the CSS, which was in collection from April 23 to June 9, 2021. “Q3 2021”: Wave 2 (August 6 to September 18, 2021). “Q4 2021”: Wave 3 (October 26 to December 7, 2021). “Q1 2022”: Wave 4 (January 28 to March 13, 2022). “Q2 2022”: Wave 5 (April 22 to June 5, 2022). “Q3 2022”: Wave 6 (July 15 to August 28, 2022)."
3,"The Canadian Social Survey (CSS) collects data every three months on different topics such as health, well-being, impacts of COVID-19, activities, time use, and emergency preparedness. The target population for this voluntary survey is all non-institutionalized persons 15 years of age and older, living off reserve in Canada’s 10 provinces. Data are collected through self-response via an electronic questionnaire or by computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Proxy responses are not permitted."
4,"Sense of meaning and purpose is measured on a scale from 0 to 10. Respondents were asked, “Using a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means ‘Not at all’ and 10 means ‘Completely,’ to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?” Respondents who did not answer this question were excluded from the calculations in this table."
5,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with an estimate. A wider confidence interval indicates higher variability, meaning that the estimate should be interpreted with due caution. The 95% confidence interval of an estimate means that if the survey were repeated over and over, the confidence interval would cover the true population value 95% of the time (or 19 times out of 20). Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals."
6,"Estimates flagged with the letter E should be used with caution. In these cases, data users should use the 95% confidence interval to assess whether the quality of the estimate is sufficient. The letter F indicates estimates that are too unreliable to be published."
7,"Gender refers to an individual’s personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman). A person’s gender may differ from their sex at birth and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents, such as their birth certificate, passport or driver’s licence. A person’s gender may change over time. Some people may not identify with a specific gender."
8,"Given that the non-binary population is small, it is necessary to aggregate the data to protect the confidentiality of responses provided by the Canadian population. Most information from the Canadian Social Survey is disseminated using a two-category gender variable. In these cases, people in the “non-binary person” category are distributed into the other two gender categories."
9,"“Non-immigrant” refers to a person who was born in Canada or who is a Canadian citizen by birth."
10,"“Immigrant” refers to a person who is, or who has ever been, a landed immigrant or permanent resident. Such a person has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by immigration authorities. Immigrants who have obtained Canadian citizenship by naturalization are included in this group."
11,"“Non-permanent resident” refers to a person from another country with a usual place of residence in Canada and who has a work or study permit or who has claimed refugee status (asylum claimant). Family members living with work or study permit holders are also included, unless these family members are already Canadian citizens, landed immigrants or permanent residents."
12,"The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as “persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.” In analytical and communications products, the term “visible minority” has been replaced by the terms “racialized population” or “racialized groups”, reflecting the increased use of these terms in the public sphere."
13,"This category includes Indigenous persons as well as persons who were not considered to be members of a visible minority group."
14,"The data do not include people living on reserves or in the territories."
15,"To identify persons with and without a disability, difficulty or long-term condition, respondents were first asked about any long-term health conditions or difficulties they had related to seeing, hearing, walking, using stairs, using their hands or fingers or doing other physical activities, learning, remembering or concentrating, and about any emotional, psychological or mental health condition, or any other health problem or long-term condition. Only conditions that have lasted or are expected to last six months or longer were included. Participants were then asked if they identified as a person with a disability. This differs from the method used by Statistics Canada in the Canadian Survey on Disability, which includes disability screening questions to identify persons with a disability and calculate the official rates of disability in Canada."
16,"Includes persons who identified as a person with a disability and/or reported at least one long-term difficulty or condition. Individuals could have indicated more than one type of disability, difficulty or long-term condition."
17,"Caution should be used when interpreting results for persons with a disability, difficulty or long-term condition because of the collection method and survey coverage. Data were collected through self-response via an electronic questionnaire with telephone interview follow-up for non-response. The overall accessibility of the survey was reduced since it was not available in other formats, such as American Sign Language or Langue des signes québécoise and braille, and no proxy reporting was allowed, meaning that family members or caregivers could not respond on behalf of a person with a long-term condition or disability. Excluded from the survey's coverage are full-time residents of institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, residential care facilities, such as group homes for persons with disabilities or addictions, shelters, correctional and custodial facilities."
18,"This category includes people who reported their sexual orientation as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, or a sexual orientation not elsewhere classified. It also includes persons whose reported sex assigned at birth does not correspond to their gender, including those whose gender is not exclusively man or woman (regardless of sexual orientation)."
19,"This category includes people who reported their sexual orientation as heterosexual and whose reported sex assigned at birth is the same as their gender."
20,"This category includes persons who reported their main activity during the last week as one of the following: “Vacation from paid work,” “Looking for paid work,” “Going to school, including vacation from school,” “Caring for children,” “Household work,” “Maternity/paternity or parental leave,” “Long-term illness,” “Volunteering,” “Caregiving other than for children” or “Other.”"
21,"In this table, “urban areas” are defined as all areas that are inside of census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs), and “rural areas” are defined as all areas that are outside of CMAs and CAs. The CMA and CA definitions are based on Statistics Canada’s 2016 Standard Geographical Classification (SGC)."
